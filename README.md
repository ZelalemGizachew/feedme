## Introduction

Welcome to Feed Me, a platform dedicated to reducing food waste by connecting businesses with surplus food to those in need. Our mission is to create a more compassionate and sustainable approach to food distribution, inspired by real-world stories like that of Bryan, who was fired for selflessly distributing surplus food.

## Inspiration

Our inspiration comes from the story of Bryan, who faced consequences for distributing surplus food to the needy. Witnessing such instances, we recognized the widespread food waste problem in businesses. Feed Me aims to be a solution by providing a platform for businesses, including restaurants, grocery stores, food courts, and hotels, to safely donate excess food.

## Features

### Business Registration

- Centralized hub for businesses to register.
- Capture essential details such as business name, category, pick-up times, location coordinates, and contact person information.

### Streamlined Contribution

- User-friendly website for businesses to contribute surplus food seamlessly.

### Admin Page

- Efficient monitoring and coordination of donations through the admin page.
- Ensures a seamless connection between donors and those in need.

## Built With

- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Backend:** Django
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), PythonAnywhere (Backend)
- **Maps Integration:** Google Maps for precise business location management.

## Challenges

We encountered a challenge obtaining a Google Maps API key due to the lack of a credit/debit card for project creation. However, we adapted swiftly, integrating the OpenStreetMap API as an alternative solution to ensure uninterrupted location functionality.

## Accomplishments

We're proud to have completed our first Minimum Viable Product (MVP), marking a significant milestone in our project's development.

## What We Learned

Through Feed Me, we've gained insights into transforming ideas into impactful solutions. We've also expanded our skills with new technologies, including Django, Angular, and Swagger.

## Next Steps for Feed Me

We are committed to continually updating our platform, adding more features, and collaborating with NGOs and charity organizations to extend our reach and truly make a difference in helping those in need.
